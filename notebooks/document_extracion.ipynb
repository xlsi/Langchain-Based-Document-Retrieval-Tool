Hence, they better reflect the group’s underlying performance. Adjusted figures are non -SFRS(I) \\nmeasures. Please refer to Section 7 of our financial results for reconciliations between the adjusted and their equivalent \\nmeasures.  \\nAll figures are for the year except for figures in brackets, which are for the year earlier unless otherwise stated. Figures may \\nbe subject to rounding.  \\nThe presentation of revenue in our 1H FY2024 income statement has been revised to the following four operating segments \\n– Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities; Equities – Cash; Equities – Derivatives; and Platform and Others1. 1H FY2023 \\nrevenue h as been reclassified to the four operating segments for a like -for-like comparison against 1H FY2024.  \\nSingapore Exchange (SGX  Group ) today reported 1H FY202 4 adjusted net profit of S$ 251.4  million \\n(S$2 36.8 million).  Adjusted EBITDA rose to  S$344.6 million ( S$334.1 million) , while  adjusted earnings \\nper share increased to  23.5 cents (22.2 cents).  \\nRevenue  increased 3.6% to S$592.2 million ( S$571.4 million), mainly driven by higher revenues from \\nCurrencies and Commodities2 and Platform and Others, partially offset by lower Equities – Cash2 and \\nEquities – Derivatives2 revenue.  \\nThe Board of Directors has declared an interim quarterly dividend of 8.5 cents (8.0 cents) per share, \\npayable on 20 February 2024. This brings total dividends in 1H FY2024 to 17.0 cents (16.0 cents) per \\nshare.  \\nLoh Boon Chye, Chief Executive Officer of SGX Group, said, “Our multi -asset offering continued to \\nserve our customers well in a persistently challenging macro environment .

To \\ndrive growth, we will focus on expanding our solutions  to capture opportunities in Asia , grow  our \\nemerging products and further strengthen our global distribution and network ,” added Mr. Loh.  \\nResults Summary  \\nFixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC)   \\nFICC revenue increased 28.1% to S$151.9 million ( S$118.5 million) and accounted for 25.6% (20.7%) \\nof total revenue3. \\nFICC – Fixed  Income  \\nFixed Income revenue decreased 8.4% to S$3.9 million ( S$4.3 million).  \\n▪ Listing revenue: S$2.5 million, down 1.4%  from S$2.6 million  \\n▪ Corporate actions and other revenue: S$1.4 million, down 19.1% from S$1.7 million  \\nThere were 489 bond listings raising S$131.7 billion, compared with  449 bond listings raising S$104.3 \\nbillion a year earlier.  \\nFICC – Currencies  and Commodities  \\nCurrencies and Commodities revenue increased 29.5% to S$148.0 million ( S$114.3 million). OTC FX \\nrevenue was S$40.9 million ( S$36.2 million) and accounted for 27.7% (31.7%) of Currencies and \\nCommodities revenue.  \\n▪ Trading and clearing revenue: S$111.3 million, up 25.3% from S$88.8 million  \\n▪ Treasury and other revenue: S$36.7 million, up 44.3% from S$25.4 million  \\nTrading and clearing revenue grew by S$22.4 million, mainly from increased volumes in commodity \\nderivatives and OTC FX transactions.  \\nCommodity derivatives volumes increased 4 8.3% to  28.7  million contracts (19.4 million contracts), \\nprimarily due to higher volumes in iron ore derivatives.  \\n  \\nCurrency derivatives volumes increased 23.8% to 23.0 million contracts (18.6 million contracts) \\nmainly from higher volumes in our USD/CNH FX futures.  \\nOTC FX average daily volume (ADV)  increased 46.4% to US$100.1 billion (US$68.4  billion).   \\n  \\nTreasury and other revenue increased mainly due to higher average yields on margin deposits, \\npartially offset by a decrease in margin balances.  \\n3 As a result of the new presentation format, the main change in the FICC segment is the reclassification of revenue streams \\nfrom EMC and Baltic Exchange to Platform and Others.

Secondary equity \\nfunds  raised were S$0.6 billion ( S$2.4 billion).  \\nDaily average traded value (DAV) and total traded value declined 11.5 % and 12.2 % to S$1.0 billion \\n(S$1.1 billion) and S$121.2  billion ( S$138.1 billion) respectively. This was made up of Cash Equities4, \\nwhere total traded value decreased by 11.9% to S$116.0 billion ( S$131.6 billion),  and Other \\nProducts5, where traded value decreased 19.5% to S$5.2 billion ( S$6.5 billion).  There were 126 (127) \\ntrading days in the first half of FY2024.  \\nOverall average clearing fees decreased 2.1% to 2.47 basis points (2.53 basis points). Average \\nclearing fees for Cash Equities decreased 2.3 % to 2.55 basis points (2.61 basis points) due to a higher \\nproportion of market maker participation. Average clearing fee for Other Products decreased 3.6% to \\n0.79 basis points (0.82 basis points) due to a higher proportion of lower yielding daily leverage \\ncertificates in 1H FY24 . Overall turnover velocity for the first half of FY2024 was 34% (37%).  \\nThe increase in securities settlement, depository management, corporate action and other revenue \\nwas mainly due to higher interest income from handling of corporate actions, partially offset by \\nlower number of settlement instructions.  \\nEquities – Derivatives  \\nEquities – Derivatives  revenue declined 6.9% to S$160.7 million ( S$172.6 million) and accounted for \\n27.1 % (30.2 %) of total revenue.  \\n▪ Trading and clearing revenue: S$123.2  million, down 15.3 % from S$145.4 million  \\n▪ Treasury and other revenue: S$37.5 million, up 37.7% from S$27.2 million  \\nThe decline in trading and clearing  revenue was due to a 14.0% decline in total equity derivatives \\nvolumes, mainly from declines in volumes of GIFT Nifty and FTSE China A50 index futures contracts. \\nExcluding Nifty, trading and clearing revenue decreased 5.1%.  \\n  \\nTreasury and other revenue increased mainly due to higher average yields on margin deposits, \\npartially offset by a decrease in margin balances.  \\nAverage fee per contract for Equity, Currency and Commodity derivatives was lower at S$1.54 \\n(S$1.58) mainly driven by a decline in the average fee of Nifty 50 index futures, due to reclass of NSE \\n4 Cash Equities include ordinary shares, real -estate investment trusts and business trusts.  \\n5 Other Products include structured warrants, exchange -traded funds, daily leverage certificates, debt securities and \\nAmerican depository receipts.

On a pro forma basis6, 1H FY2024 \\naverage fee per contract remained comparable at S$1.54 ( S$1.53) from a year ago.  \\nPlatform and Others  \\nPlatform and Others revenue increased 8.0% to S$120.1 million ( S$111.2 million) and accounted for \\n20.3% (19.5%) of total revenue.  \\n▪ Market data revenue: S$24.2 million, up 9.9% from S$22.0 million  \\n▪ Connectivity revenue: S$38.5 million, up 8.7% from S$35.4 million  \\n▪ Indices and other revenue7: S$57.4 million, up 6.8% from S$53.8 million  \\nThe increase in Market data revenue was driven by higher revenue realised from Securities and \\nDerivatives Market Direct Feed subscribers, as well as growth in distribution of Commodities data . \\nThe increase in Connectivity revenue was mainly due to  higher revenue from co -location subscribers.  \\nIndices and other revenue increased  mainly from higher revenue contribution from EMC and Indices.  \\nExpenses Overview  \\nTotal expenses increased 3.0% to S$296.1 million ( S$287.4 million), mainly from higher staff costs \\nand technology costs, offset by lower royalties and professional fees.  \\nAdjusted total expenses increased 3.5% to S$289.7 million (S$279.9 million), which excludes \\namortisation of purchased intangible  asset s. \\nTotal capital expenditure was S$18.5 million ( S$17.8 million). These investments include upgrades to \\nour Titan OTC trade reporting system, modernisation of our technology infrastructure and \\nconsolidation of our office spaces.  \\nWe are cautious on the near -term outlook as prospects for global growth appear muted. Rising \\ngeopolitical tensions and divergence in economic performance are likely to add to the headwinds \\nand uncertainties that we are facing. As such, we will remain prudent in managing our expenses and \\ncapital expenditure.  \\nExpense growth in FY2024 is likely to be similar to the 3% year -on-year expense growth rate \\nobserved in the first half of FY2024, lower than the previously guided mid -single digit percentage \\nrange. Our projected capital expenditure for FY2024 is anticipated to be within S$70-75 million, \\nlower than our previously guided S$75-80 million range.  \\n-End- \\n6 Under the fee arrangement  with the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) that commenced on 1 July 2023 (GIFT \\nConnect), royalties expense for GIFT Nifty no longer applies; and the fee payable to  NSE is netted -off against Equities – \\nDerivatives Trading & Clearing revenue. 1H FY2023 average fee per contract has been adjusted on this basis for a like -for-\\nlike comparison.  \\n7 Includes revenues from Scientific Beta, Index Edge, EMC and Baltic Exchange, as well as membership -related fees.
